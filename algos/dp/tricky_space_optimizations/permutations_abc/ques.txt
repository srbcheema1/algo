a string is nice only if it contains one of the following pattern in it:
123,132,213,231,312,321
you are given length n, you have to find how many nice strings can be formed of it

for example n = 3
    123,132,213 ... are nice

for example n = 4
    1123, 3123, 3213 are nice
    1111, 2113 are not nice
